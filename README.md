# PyGame
Just a fun little RPG project!

To try it out, just downloads the contents, make sure you have python 3 installed, and start up main.py by navigating to the directory you downloaded to and typing "python main.py".

It should theoretically work almost exactly the same in Unix as in Windows, but I primarily develop on Windows, so you'll need to grab that for the best experience.

Have fun!
